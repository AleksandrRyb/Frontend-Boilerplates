## What are the Boilerplates?

These Boilerplates are examples of how create web applications with different technologies, all them are used in projects in production, and some of them are continuously updated.

To create them we have tried to follow the best of practices that we know, and if the Boilerplate is not enough for you, maybe some of these practices can help (SCSS Structures, How to import Bootstrap, Dependency Injection in TypeScript, etc.).

## Why Boilerplates and no Templates?

The idea is to don't use them as templates in our projects but you can use them if you want. Why we don't like to use as templates?.

Because we like to use these Boilerplates as reference of good practices and tips for each technology, sometimes we directly download the Boilerplate and use it as template, but in some other projects we only use some of the parts that the Boilerplates have.

## Do we update the Boilerplates?

We update these Boilerplates in our free time, most of them by Quique (@CKGrafico) and we usually update each Boilerplate after use it in a project, because each time we use a Boilerplate we like to refactor some parts and add or remove some others. That means that versioning is important in the Boilerplates and if you use a Boilerplate you can find a new version in some months.
